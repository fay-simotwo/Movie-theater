# Movie Ticket Booking
Welcome to the Movie Ticket Booking project! The Movie Ticket Booking System is a web application that allows users to browse and book movie tickets online. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can view a list of available movies, their showtimes, and ticket availability. Users can select a movie, view its details such as poster, title, runtime, and available tickets, and proceed to book a ticket if seats are available.

## Key Features:
- Movie Menu: The application displays a menu of movies, allowing users to browse through the available options.
- Movie Details: Users can click on a movie to view its details, including poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
- Ticket Booking: If there are available tickets, users can book a ticket for the selected movie by clicking the "Buy Ticket" button.
- Ticket Availability: The system keeps track of ticket availability and updates it in real-time when a ticket is purchased.
- Sold Out Message: If all tickets for a movie are sold out, a "Sold Out" message is displayed to notify the users.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on different devices and screen sizes.
